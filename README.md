## Minimal working examples (scripts-mwe)

These are minimal working examples to present how to make use of the GPO-SMC-ABC algorithm in some simple cases.

### Linear Gaussian state space model (gpo-lgss)
We consider parameter inference in a linear Gaussian state space (LGSS) model given by x_{t+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(x_{t+1}; \phi x_t, \sigma_v^2) and y_t \sim \mathcal{N}(y_t; x_t, \sigma_e^2) with the parameters {\phi,\sigma_v,\sigma_e}. We assume that \sigma_e is known and set it to 0.1. We simulate 100 data points using the parameters \phi=0.75 and \sigma_v=1 from the model. We make use of N=100 particles and 150 iterations of the GPO algorithm. 

### Stochastic volatility model with simulated data (gpo-sv)
We consider parameter inference in a stochastic volatility (SV) model given by x_{t+1} = \mu + \phi ( x_t - \mu ) +  \sigma_v v_t and y_t = exp(x_t/2) e_t, where v_t and e_t are standard Gaussian random variables with correlation \rho. In this model, we have the parameters {\mu,\phi,\sigma_v,\rho}. We simulate 500 data points using the parameters {0.20,0.90.0.15,-0.70} from the model. We make use of N=50 particles and 250 iterations of the GPO algorithm to estimate the paramters {\mu,\phi,\sigma_v}.
