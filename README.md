# gpo-abc2015
This code was downloaded from < https://github.com/compops/gpo-abc2015 > and contains the code used to produce the results in

J. Dahlin, M. Villani and  T. B. Sch√∂n, "Approximate Bayesian inference using Gaussian process optimisation applied to intractable likelihood models". Pre-print, arXiv:1506.06975v1, 2015.

The paper is available as a preprint from < http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06975 > and < http://liu.johandahlin.com/ >.

## Dependencies

The code is written and tested for Python 2.7.6. The implementation makes use of NumPy 1.9.2, SciPy 0.15.1, Matplotlib 1.4.3, Pandas 0.13.1, GPy 0.6.0 and DIRECT 1.0.1. Please have these packages installed, on Ubuntu they can be installed using "sudo pip install --upgrade package-name ". For more information about, the GPy package see < https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/ > and the DIRECT package see < http://pythonhosted.org/DIRECT/ >

## Minimal working examples (scripts-mwe)

These are minimal working examples to present how to make use of the GPO-SMC-ABC algorithm in some simple cases.

### Linear Gaussian state space model (gpo-lgss)

### Stochastic volatility model with simulated data (gpo-sv and gpo-abc-sv)


## Replication scripts for paper (scripts-draft1)
